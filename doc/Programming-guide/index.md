The intention of this guide is to introduce Kaa platform programming basics to you.
You will have to roll up your sleeves with Kaa (at least so we hope), so come prepared.
In order for the guide to be useful, make sure that you have a development environment set up, including a Kaa server instance.
We recommend that you use Kaa Sandbox, which is covered in [the Getting Started guide]({{root_url}}Getting-started/), but you can [use a Kaa cluster]({{root_url}}Administration-guide/System-installation/Cluster-setup/) instead, if you like.

# Sections overview

It is best to dive directly into the practice [by creating basic Kaa application]({{root_url}}Programming-guide/Your-first-Kaa-application/).
You will learn a lot about Kaa during this basic training.
With fresh new knowlegle you could start familiarize with [a system overview of the Kaa platform]({{root_url}}Programming-guide/System-overview/) and then go through [application-level features that our platform provides to you]({{root_url}}Programming-guide/Key-platform-features/)

You then can advance your skills and create industrial-level projects by using [client-side SDK]({{root_url}}Programming-guide/Using-Kaa-endpoint-SDKs/) provided in different languages and for different platforms.
Make sure you do not miss our [REST API documentation]({{root_url}}Programming-guide/Server-REST-APIs/) which provides overview of a great automation tool.

Finally, if anything goes wrong you can always refer to [the troubleshooting section]({{root_url}}Programming-guide/Debugging-and-troubleshooting/) or ask for help in our [community forum](https://groups.google.com/group/kaaproject).
