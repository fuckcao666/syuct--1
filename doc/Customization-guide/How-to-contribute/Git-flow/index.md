We use a [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). That means, you should branch from the main repository and contribute back via pull requests. That's de facto standard workflow on GitHub with a couple of additional rules.

## Main branches

We have two main long-running branches: `master` and `develop`. `master` always points to the latest released versionâ€”**no pull requests are accepted to master**. `develop` is a main development branch; it reflects the latest development status. Usually, new changes should go there.

There may be a number of short-living branches; most of them are used for specific jira tickets. However, `release-xxx` branches are special. They are pre-release branches which are used to test and stabilize everything before actual release. (Actual releases are tagged.) **Only bugfixes are accepted to release branches.**

There may be develop branches for releases following after the next one; they took a form of `develop-xxx` (e.g., `develop-1.0.0`). Usually, you should avoid committing to them and use branches for specific features.

## Clonning

The main Kaa repository is located here: <https://github.com/kaaproject/kaa>. To contribute to the Kaa you need to fork it (click fork button on the page), then clone your new repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:<your_github_name>/kaa.git # Replace <your_github_name> with your github name.
cd kaa
```

You may need to sync with the main repository, so it's good to add it to remotes:

```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/kaaproject/kaa.git
```

The rest of the guide assumes the above command was executed, so `upstream` points to `kaaproject/kaa`.

## Merge requirements

### Branch off from appropriate branch

First of all, you should decide what branch you will base your changes on. Generally, that's the `develop` branch.

The rules are the following:

- `release-xxx` if your change is a **bugfix** that should go to the release *xxx* and there is such branch. That's either updates to patch releases or pre-release hotfixes.
- `develop` if you want your change in the next minor version bump. (Minor is a second version component. e.g. 0.8.1 -> 0.9.0 is a minor bump. Note also that 0.9.1 -> 1.0.0 is a minor bump as well.)
- `develop-xxx` if your change shouldn't go to the next release. Usually, you know that; if you don't, that's a wrong branch.
- `master` -- never.

Consult fix version field in Jira to see release version for your change.

Note also that that's is a branch you will open pull request against later.

It's always a good idea to fetch newest changes from the branch before starting:

```sh
git checkout develop # assuming you branch off from develop
git pull
```

### Opened against appropriate branch

You must open the pull request against the branch you've branched from.

### No merge conflicts

Resolve any merge conflicts that may arise. (GitHub will display a warning on the pull request page.)

You can do that with the following commands:

```sh
# checkout a branch you open PR from
git fetch upstream # assuming upstream is kaaproject/kaa
git merge upstream/merge_branch # Where merge_branch is a branch you open pull request against.
# resolve pull requests
git add changed_files
git commit
git push
```

GitHub will automatically update your pull request.

### Tests

All pull requests are automatically checked with Travis and Jenkins. If any of the tests fails, fix it or describe why it can't be done.

### Review

The pull request must have at least two LGTM (Looks Good To Me) from the members of the team responsible for a changed component and shouldn't have any open review questions.

## Gatekeepers

Gatekeeper is a person who is responsible for the final review and merge; he is also responsible for managing git repositories. That is the only person who can write to master, develop and release branches.

If the pull request satisfies all merge requirements, one of gatekeepers should do a final review and merge.
