## Introduction

This guide provides an overview of Kaa platform installation.

## System requirements

To use Kaa, your system must meet the following minimum system requirements:

   * 64-bit OS
   
   for single kaa-node service with all third party components (SQL, NoSQL, Zookeeper, etc.) deployed remotely
   
   * 256 Mb RAM
   
   for kaa-node with all third party components deployed on the same node
   
   * 4 Gb RAM

## Supported OS

Kaa supports the following operating system families and provides installation packages for each of them.

The following operating systems are supported:

   * CentOS 6
   * Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6
   * Oracle Linux 5
   * Oracle Linux 6
   * Ubuntu 14.04
   * Ubuntu 16.04

Please note that the instructions from this guide were tested on Ubuntu 14.04, Ubuntu 16.04 and Centos 6.7. Instructions for other OS may have minor differences.

## Software Requirements

   * yum (for RHEL or CentOS)
   * rpm (for RHEL, CentOS, or SLES)
   * scp
   * curl
   * wget
   * unzip
   * tar

## Third party components

Kaa requires the following third party components to be installed and configured.

* [Oracle JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). Kaa has been tested on JDK 8
* [PostgreSQL 9.4](http://www.postgresql.org/download/) or [MariaDB 5.5](https://mariadb.org/download/). Kaa has been tested on the latest production release of PostgreSQL and MariaDB.
* [Zookeeper 3.4.5](http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.5/). Kaa requires ZooKeeper for coordination of server components.

Kaa also requires [MongoDB 2.6.9](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads) or [Cassandra 3.5](http://cassandra.apache.org/download/) as a NoSQL database. 
The installation steps for third-party components are provided in the following section.

### Zookeeper

Apache ZooKeeper enables highly reliable distributed coordination of Kaa cluster nodes. Each Kaa node pushes information about connection parameters, 
enabled services and corresponding services load. Other Kaa nodes use this information in order to get list of their neighbors and communicate with them. 
Control service uses information about existing Bootstrap services and their connection parameters during SDK generation.

### SQL database

SQL database instance is used to store metadata about tenants, applications, endpoint groups, etc. 
This information is shared between endpoints, thus it's volume does not scale and it can be efficiently stored in modern SQL databases. 
To support high availability of Kaa cluster, SQL database should be also deployed in cluster mode.

Kaa supports two SQL databases at the moment: PostgresSQL and MariaDB. If you plan to use kaa in a single node instance we recommend you to use 
PostgreSQL and MariaDB for multi node cluster because of better clusterization capabilities of MariaDB.

### NoSQL database

NoSQL database instance is used to store information about endpoint profiles, notifications, configurations, etc. The volume of this information scales 
linearly with amount of endpoints that are managed using particular Kaa cluster instance. 
NoSQL database nodes can be co-located with Kaa nodes on the same physical or virtual machines. 
Kaa supports Apache Cassandra and MongoDB as a NoSQL database at the moment. 
The choose between MongoDB and Apache Cassandra depends only on your specific data analysis needs.

## Installing Kaa

Kaa platform provides you several options for kaa-node server installation, for more detail on how to install your Kaa server please refer to next sections.

### Single node installation

If you need to install and configure Kaa components on a single Linux node refer to [Single node installation](Single-node-installation) documentation page.

### Node cluster setup

To learn how to create kaa-node cluster refer to [Node cluster setup](Cluster-setup) documentation page.
