| Bootstrap server                                        | One of the three server types in Kaa, with the other two being the Control server and Operations server. A Bootstrap server is responsible for directing endpoints to Operations servers. On their part, Kaa endpoints have a built-in list of Bootstrap servers set up in the given Kaa deployment. The endpoints use this list to query the Bootstrap servers and retrieve from them a list of currently available Operations servers, as well as security credentials. Bootstrap servers maintain their lists of available Operations servers by coordinating with the ZooKeeper service.

| Client (also,Kaa client)                                | A particular application or piece of software which uses the Kaa endpoint SDK and resides on a particular connected device. It is the responsibility of the Kaa client to process structured data provided by the Kaa server (configuration, notifications, etc.) and to supply data to the return path interfaces (profiles, logs, etc.). Refer to Design reference main page for more information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Configuration schema                                    | A user-defined specification of the application data model that Kaa Configuration subsystem uses to configure endpoints registered under the application. In other words, the configuration schema defines in which format the actual configuration data should be entered by the user/developer and then transferred to the endpoints. Note that there can be several schemas created for a single application. The version of the schema for the endpoint is selected during SDK generation. Refer to Configuration and Administration UI guide for more information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Configuration data (in short,configuration)             | A set of configuration values specified by the user based on the corresponding configuration schema. Having been specified on the server, these values are then distributed to the endpoints that belong to the corresponding application and support the corresponding configuration schema. Refer to Configuration for more information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Control server                                          | One of the three server types in Kaa, with the other two being the Bootstrap server and Operations server. It is responsible for managing overall system data, processing API calls from the web UI and external integrated systems, and delivering notifications to Operations servers. A Control server manages data stored in a database (independently for each tenant) and notifies every Operations server on most data updates via a Thrift-based protocol. A Control server maintains an up-to-date list of available Operations servers by continuously obtaining this information from ZooKeeper.To support high availability, a Kaa cluster must include at least two Control servers, with one of them being active and the other(s) being in a standby mode. In case of the active Control server failure, ZooKeeper notifies one of the standby Control servers and promotes it to the active Control server.Refer to Design reference main page for more information. |

| Delta (also,delta update)                               | The difference between the new configuration created on the server (and due to be applied to the endpoint) and the current configuration used by the endpoint. The delta is sent to the endpoint and then merged with the endpoint current configuration to achieve the required up-to-date configuration. Using deltas instead of full configuration resets is an effective way to reduce load on available data channels.

| Endpoint (EP)                                           | An abstraction which represents a separate managed entity within a Kaa deployment. Practically speaking, an endpoint is a specific Kaa client (see Client) registered (or waiting to be registered) within a Kaa deployment. For example, a news application installed on your mobile phone, the same news application installed on your tablet, and the same news application on your WiFi-enabled fridge would be considered three different endpoints in Kaa.

| Endpoint group                                          | An independent managed entity which is defined by the profile filters assigned to it. Those endpoints whose profiles match the profile filters of the specific endpoint group become automatically registered as members of this group. There is no restriction for endpoints on having membership in more than one group at a time. Refer to Endpoint grouping for more information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Endpoint group profile filter (in short,profile filter) | A predicate expression based on the Spring Expression Language which defines characteristics of the corresponding group members (endpoints). These filters are executed against the endpoint profile to figure out whether or not the endpoint belongs to the group. Refer to Endpoint profiling for more information. Refer to Endpoint grouping for more information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Endpoint profile                                        | A structured data set of custom-defined complexity that describes specific characteristics of the endpoint.

| Event class schema                                      | An Avro-based schema used for specifying an event structure. An event class schema contains the classType attribute that supports two values: event and object. Kaa uses the classType attribute to distinguish actual events from objects, which are reusable parts of events. This is useful for avoiding redundant methods in SDK API. Refer to Events for more information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Event class family (ECF)                                | A group of events related together by the event subject. ECFs are registered within the Kaa tenant together with the corresponding event class family schemas. An ECF is uniquely identified by its name and/or class name and tenant. In other words, there can be no two ECFs with the same name or same class name within a single tenant.

| Kaa framework                                           | The Kaa framework consists of the Kaa server and endpoint SDKs. The Kaa server implements the back-end part of the framework, exposes integration interfaces, and offers administrative capabilities. An endpoint SDK is a library which provides communication, data marshaling, persistence, and other functions available in Kaa for specific type of an endpoint (e.g. Java-based, C++-based, C-based). This SDK can be used to create Kaa clients, which are any pieces of software that utilize Kaa functionality and are installed on some connected devices. It is the responsibility of the Kaa client to process structured data provided by the Kaa server (configuration, notifications, etc.) and to supply data to the return path interfaces (profiles, logs, etc.).Refer to Design reference main page for more information.                                                                                                                                         |
| Kaa instance (also,Kaa deployment)                      | A particular implementation of the Kaa framework and it consists of a Kaa cluster and endpoints. A Kaa cluster represents a number of interconnected Kaa servers. An endpoint is an abstraction which represents a separate managed entity within a Kaa deployment. Practically speaking, an endpoint is a specific Kaa client registered (or waiting to be registered) within a Kaa deployment. For example, a news application installed on your mobile phone, the same news application installed on your tablet, and the same news application on your WiFi-enabled fridge would be considered three different endpoints in Kaa.

This utility is responsible for writing logs (received by the Operations server from endpoints) to a single specific storage, as defined by the log appender's type. Each Kaa application may use only one log appender at a time. A Kaa developer is able to add, update and delete log appenders using Admin UI or REST API. Kaa provides several default implementations of log appenders. It is also possible to create custom log appenders. Refer to Log appenders for more information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Log schema                                              | Defines the structure of logs collected by endpoints and subsequently transferred to the server. A log schema is fully compatible with the Apache Avro schema. There is one log schema defined by default for each Kaa application. This schema supports versioning, therefore, whenever a new log schema is configured on the Kaa server for the application, this new schema gets a new sequence version assigned. The Kaa server maintains compatibility with the older versions of the log schema to ensure proper functioning of the clients that for some reason are not yet upgraded to the latest schema version.

| Operations server                                       | One of the three server types in Kaa, with the other two being the Bootstrap server and Control server. An Operations server is a “worker” server that is responsible for concurrently handling multiple requests from multiple clients. Most common Operations server tasks include endpoint registration, endpoint profile updating, configuration updates distribution, and notifications delivery.Multiple Operations servers may be set up in a Kaa cluster for the purpose of horizontal scaling. In this case, all the Operations servers will function concurrently. In case an Operations server outage happens, the corresponding endpoints switch to the other available Operations server automatically. A Kaa cluster provides instruments for the workload re-balancing at run time, thus effectively routing endpoints to the less loaded Operations servers in the cluster.
